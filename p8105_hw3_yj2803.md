# Problem 1

**Data import setup**

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart") # call instacart data from the library 
```

The instacart data has 1384617 rows and 15 columns. Some key variables
include order_id, product_id, user_id, product_name, etc.

**Examples of observations in instacart dataset**

``` r
head(instacart, n = 8) |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 1) # include table in the md file
```

The above example shows detailed information about `order_id` = 1. As we
can see from the table, `order_id` is tied to specific IDs which
identify product, user, aisle and department. From `product_name`, we
can tell what the user got for this order. `order_number` = 4 means that
this was the 4th order from this customer. `order_dow`,
`order_hour_of_day`, and `days_since_prior` tell us that this order was
placed on the 4th week, between 10 am to 11 am, and 9 days since the
last order. `reordered` is recorded as 1 if the product has been ordered
by this user in the past, and 0 otherwise.

``` r
# summarize aisle data
df_aisles <- instacart |> 
  group_by(aisle_id, aisle) |> 
  summarise(count = n())  # count how many times aisle_id were recorded in the dataset for each id (= the number of items ordered from each aisle)

max_aisle <- max(pull(df_aisles, count)) # check maximum count of aisles

df_aisles_max <- df_aisles |> 
  filter(count == max_aisle) # filter by the maximum count of aisles
```

134 aisles are in this dataset, and **fresh vegetables** are the most
items (in total 150609 items) ordered from.

The following plot shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered.

``` r
# make a plot (the number of items ordered in each aisle)
df_aisles |> 
  filter(count > 10000) |> # just show aisles with more than 10000 items 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, count), y = count)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  labs(
    title = "Items by aisle",
    x = "Aisle",
    y = "Item count",
    caption = "Only showing aisles with more than 10000 items ordered; sorted in an ascending order"
  )
```

  group_by(order_dow) |> 
  summarise("mean_hour" = mean(order_hour_of_day)) # show the mean hour of the day on each day of the week

pink_lady_apples |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 1) # show table in md file 
```
