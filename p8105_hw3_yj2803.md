# Problem 1

**Data import setup**

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart") # call instacart data from the library 
```

The instacart data has 1384617 rows and 15 columns. Some key variables
include order_id, product_id, user_id, product_name, etc.

**Examples of observations in instacart dataset**

``` r
head(instacart, n = 8) |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 1) # include table in the md file
```

The above example shows detailed information about `order_id` = 1. As we
can see from the table, `order_id` is tied to specific IDs which
identify product, user, aisle and department. From `product_name`, we
can tell what the user got for this order. `order_number` = 4 means that
this was the 4th order from this customer. `order_dow`,
`order_hour_of_day`, and `days_since_prior` tell us that this order was
placed on the 4th week, between 10 am to 11 am, and 9 days since the
last order. `reordered` is recorded as 1 if the product has been ordered
by this user in the past, and 0 otherwise.

``` r
# summarize aisle data
df_aisles <- instacart |> 
  group_by(aisle_id, aisle) |> 
  summarise(count = n())  # count how many times aisle_id were recorded in the dataset for each id (= the number of items ordered from each aisle)

max_aisle <- max(pull(df_aisles, count)) # check maximum count of aisles

df_aisles_max <- df_aisles |> 
  filter(count == max_aisle) # filter by the maximum count of aisles
```

134 aisles are in this dataset, and **fresh vegetables** are the most
items (in total 150609 items) ordered from.

The following plot shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered.

``` r
# make a plot (the number of items ordered in each aisle)
df_aisles |> 
  filter(count > 10000) |> # just show aisles with more than 10000 items 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, count), y = count)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  labs(
    title = "Items by aisle",
    x = "Aisle",
    y = "Item count",
    caption = "Only showing aisles with more than 10000 items ordered; sorted in an ascending order"
  )
```

The table below provides the mean order time for Pink Lady Apples and
Coffee Ice Cream on each day of the week:

**Pink Lady Apples**

``` r
# Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream table
pink_lady_apples <- instacart |> 
  filter(product_name == c("Pink Lady Apples")) |> # filter by product name
  select(-product_name) |> 
  group_by(order_dow) |> 
  summarise("mean_hour" = mean(order_hour_of_day)) # show the mean hour of the day on each day of the week

pink_lady_apples |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 1) # show table in md file 
```

| order_dow | mean_hour |
|----------:|----------:|
|         0 |      13.4 |
|         1 |      11.4 |
|         2 |      11.7 |
|         3 |      14.2 |
|         4 |      11.6 |
|         5 |      12.8 |
|         6 |      11.9 |

**Coffee Ice Cream**

``` r
# Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream table
coffee_ice_cream <- instacart |> 
  filter(product_name == c("Coffee Ice Cream")) |> # filter by product name
  select(-product_name) |> 
  group_by(order_dow) |> 
  summarise("mean_hour" = mean(order_hour_of_day)) # show the mean hour of the day on each day of the week


coffee_ice_cream |>

|         1 |      14.3 |
|         2 |      15.4 |

# Problem 2

**Data import setup**

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010") # call BRFSS data from the library 
```

**Data cleaning**

``` r
df_brfss_cleaned <- brfss_smart2010 |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health" & response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) |>  # focus on Overall Health; only include responses from "Excellent" to "Poor"
  mutate(
    response = factor(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")) # change response as factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to “Excellent”
  )
```

- In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
  in 2010?

``` r
# check 2002
df_brfss_2002 <- df_brfss_cleaned |> 
  filter(year == 2002) |>  # filter by year 
  group_by(locationabbr) |> # group by states
  summarise(count = n() / 5) |> # count number of observations in each state
  filter(count >= 7) # show states which have >= 7 locations

# check 2010
df_brfss_2010 <- df_brfss_cleaned |> 
  filter(year == 2010) |>  # filter by year 
  group_by(locationabbr) |> # group by states
  summarise(count = n() / 5) |> # count number of observations in each state
  filter(count >= 7) # show states which have >= 7 locations
```

7 or more locations were observed in CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ, PA in 2002; CA,
CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, WA in 2010.

- Construct a dataset that is limited to `Excellent` responses, and
  contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the `data_value`
  across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this
  average value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a
  line for each state across years).

``` r
# create a dataset that is limited to "Excellent" responses
df_brfss_excellent <- df_brfss_cleaned |> 
  filter(response == "Excellent") |> # filter by response "Excellent"
  select(year, locationabbr, data_value) |> # only include necessary variables in the dataset
  group_by(locationabbr, year) |> 
  drop_na() |> # drop the missing values so that we can calculate mean value
  summarise(value_mean = mean(data_value)) # calculate mean data_value across locations within a state

# create a spaghetti plot with x being year, y being the value_mean
df_brfss_excellent |> 
  rename("state" = locationabbr) |> # renamed column for plot output
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value_mean, group = state, color = state)) + 
  geom_point() + # spaghetti plot
  geom_line() +
  theme(legend.text = element_text(size = 6)) + # changed legend text size
  guides(color = guide_legend(ncol = 3)) + # changed the number of legend columns
  labs(
    title = "The average value over time within a state",
    x = "Year",
    y = "The average value",
    caption = "Only showing data with Excellent response"
  )
```

![](p8105_hw3_yj2803_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

- Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
  distribution of `data_value` for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”)
  among locations in NY State.

``` r
library(patchwork) # to create a two-panel plot

# prepare a dataset for plot
df_ny_2006 <- df_brfss_cleaned |> 
  filter(locationabbr == "NY" & year == 2006)  # only include 2006 data in NY
  
df_ny_2010 <- df_brfss_cleaned |> 
  filter(locationabbr == "NY" & year == 2010)  # only include 2006 data in NY
  
# plot for 2006
p_ny_2006 = df_ny_2006 |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = locationdesc, y = data_value)) +
  geom_violin(aes(fill = locationdesc), color = "blue", alpha = .5) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + # change the legend location
  labs(
    title = "2006",
    x = "Location",
  )  

# plot for 2010
p_ny_2010 = df_ny_2010 |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = locationdesc, y = data_value, fill = response)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + # change the legend location
  labs(
    title = "2010",
    x = "Location",
  ) 

p_ny_2006 + p_ny_2010 # put two plots side by side
```
